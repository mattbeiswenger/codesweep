# Abstract
This project was created for an Independent Study at North Central College during Winter 2018 term.

The purpose of this project is to establish a proof of concept for an intelligent grading system for introductory computer science courses, analyzing code through both static and dynamic procedures in order to provide useful feedback for both students and professors. This intelligent grading system is presented through a web application that allows for users to gain access through any modern web browser. At the core of the web application lies client-server communication that enables users to execute and submit source code. The outputs of the source code are then graded in relation to desired results that are specified by the professor. In the process of creating this project, many security issues were made apparent, including the security implications of running arbitrary code and the difficulties of sandboxing programming languages.
